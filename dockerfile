# Container based No-IP update client, based on Alpine linux and the 
# official No-IP linux client.
# For an externally configurable alternative I strongly suggest using 
# https://github.com/coppit/docker-no-ip instead.
# This version is intended as a personal learning exercise, as well 
# as hopefully resulting in a slightly more secure implementation; 
# I wasn't comfortable with using ENV or files to pass credentials, 
# and using a Docker Secrets was slightly overkill for my use case.
# On first deploy 'run -td' , and then exec an interactive shell and 
# execute 'noip2 -C' for an interactive setup.
