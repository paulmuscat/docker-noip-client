## Container based noip update client
# for an externally configurable alternative see https://github.com/coppit/docker-no-ip
# however this is intended as a simpler, slightly more secure version;
# I didn't want to have to use ENV or files to pass credentials, 
# and using a Docker Secrets was slightly overkill for my use case.
# On first deploy exec an interactive shell and run 'noip2 -C' for an interactive setup
# then 'noip2 -d' to start the daemon running
