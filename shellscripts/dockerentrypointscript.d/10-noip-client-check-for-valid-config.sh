# Docker entrypoint subscript for noip update container. 
# Assumes running on Alpine with default build.
# Performs user config if necessary and then checks for existence of 
# noip client config file, and fixes any ownership issues - running
# config as root will otherwise cause problems.
# User setup could be offloaded to the dockerfile, but neater to keep
# everything together here, I think, and allows for these scripts to 
# be reused in non-container contexts. 
# If expected config file not found then directs user to log in and 
# run configuration;
# If found, uses the client to display the current config.
# Note - by default Alpine use busybox for standard posix functions
# runs as root, and has no sudo.
# Obviously if you set NOIPUSER to root, it will run as root instead.
